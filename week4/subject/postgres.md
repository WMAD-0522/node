Here is a brief introduction to PostgreSQL:

PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system that is widely used for managing and storing large amounts of structured data. It supports SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulating data.

SQL Queries in PostgreSQL:

`SELECT`: Used to select data from a database table. For example:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

`WHERE`: Used to filter data based on specific conditions. For example:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator value;
```

`GROUP BY`: Used to group data based on one or more columns. For example:

```sql
SELECT column1, SUM(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;
```

`JOIN`: Used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. For example:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```
